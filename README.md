# :whale: Docker

## DockerHub
https://hub.docker.com/u/shur3d

## Disclaimer
- GitHub Repository for managing all self-created Docker-Containers
- Each Dockerfile with additional artifacts in separate folders
- Additional artifacts could be bash-scripts for Contaier-Build or Executables written & built in other languages such as GO
- Build scripts for Dockerfile and additional artifacts

## Tags
The tags i use normally are the following

`experimental`

Never use a container with this tag. These ones are the ones i use to test if i try to change/improve something in my containers so the chance is high that nothing will work during a developing phase.

`latest`

Always the newest one and a good pick if you want to use always the up-to-date containers.

`*.*`

Versionized containers (e.g. `0.1`) incremented manually. If possible and if it makes sense, i may use the version declaration of the creator of the containered service. Use these if you want your container never to be updated or change and hope i do not accidently overwrite it.

## Build
1. Make sure `buildx` is working on your machine
2. Get repository

Inside the Container-folder which is to be built:

3. Build eventually necessary artifacts if you e.g. change something in the go-scripts
4. Change credentials in `build_docker.sh` to your values
5. Start terminal
6. execute `$ bash build_docker.sh`

Build should be ran and container be pushed to your DockerHub account
