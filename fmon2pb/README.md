 # fmon2pb - Folder-Monitoring to Pushbullet

## DockerHub

- https://hub.docker.com/r/shur3d/fmon2pb

## Build

See general description at https://github.com/SHU-red/Docker

## Disclaimer

- Surveilling a folder to push new images via pushbullet
- Delete oldest files if configured number of files is exceeded
- The GO-Script is contained as built executable which keeps container size low and performance high

## Target Application - SmartHome

- When  doorbell is pushed, the surveillance camera sends a snapshot image to the surveilled folder
- Image is immediately pushed to all devices
- Only a configurable amount of the latest images is kept

## Pushbullet

This service can only be connected to a single pushbullet account. Thats why you have to decide how to use this specific account, regarding your application.

### Variant 1 - Serve only a single account

Use your account and push to
- not specifying channel or device -> Pushing to all devices
- specifying cannel or device -> Pushing to specified channel or device

### Variant 2 - Serve multiple accounts

Create a dummy account, create a channel and subscribe with as many target-accounts as you like
- specify this channel to always push to your target account

## Functions

1. (GO) Folder-Monitoring, frequently checking all files in a folder
2. (Python) Pushing new found files via pushbullet-cli (installed from pip)
3. (GO) Deleting oldest files if configured number of files to keep is exceeded

## ToDo

- [ ] Build container for ARM devices

- [x] Opportunity to serve multiple accounts with notifications (using channels proviced by a dummy-account)

- [ ] Add more functionalities to execute filetype-depenent actions (e.g. Image = push file; Txt = push message; ...)
